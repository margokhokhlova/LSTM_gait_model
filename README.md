# LSTM_gait_model
Simple Keras sequential models for my gait cycle data.
For the trial, use data in data archive, these are pre-processed kinematic hip and knee parameters.
Database with joints is attached. For the simultaneous data from VICOM/KINECT, please contact me: they are too heavy to upload here.
The description of this model and results can be found in publication (currently, under review).
